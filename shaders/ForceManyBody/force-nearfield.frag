// Near-field pass of the precise grid repulsion (P3M-style). After the finest
// level pass, the only un-accumulated region is the 3×3 neighborhood of the
// point's cell.
//
// Cell centroids exert a purely radial force there, which flattens dense hubs
// into disks and petals — even as a residual for unsampled mass, the centroid
// bias dominates (tangential repulsion scaled by ~K/n never spreads a dense
// clump before alpha decays). So the near field is a pure Monte-Carlo estimator
// instead: the K depth-peeled points of a cell are a uniform random subset
// (re-drawn every tick by build-nearfield-slots.vert), and weighting each
// sampled pairwise force by count/sampled makes the expected force equal the
// exact all-pairs sum — unbiased, no centroid term. Cells holding ≤ K points
// are sampled exhaustively, so their forces are exact. The per-tick sampling
// noise acts as annealed jitter: it shrinks with alpha and is precisely what
// breaks clumps apart. The point itself is excluded from both the sample and
// the count.
